## DARTS WebUI - A minimal frontend
This repository contains everything needed to make the DARTS service stack available to end-users.
We employ a minimal approach based on Python and NiceGUI to build a clean, functional interface that can be run on client devices or dedicated game kiosks.

# Set-up:
Simply `pip install requirements.txt` and you're all set up and ready to go.
Run the `demo.py` script to get a taste of what's to come. It will serve at localhost port 1600, and may optionally be exposed to local networks or the wider Internet.
